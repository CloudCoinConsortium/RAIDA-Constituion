# CloudCoin RAIDA Administration Constitution
This Agreement states the terms and conditions that govern the contractual agreement between the RAIDA
Administer and Sean H. Worthington who agrees to be bound by this Constitution.

## WHEREAS
Each of us are endowed by our creator with inalienable natural rights; and,

## WHEREAS
Money-use is a God-given natural right that combines our rights to use math, communicate, use tools and Collaborate. God has given us a part of our brain that is dedicated to math and is useful in calculating prices, values in comparisons to amounts of money. That these natural rights are acknowledged by the Supreme laws of the United States of America and by other nations as the Right to Free Speech, Press, Association, and that freedom of the Press and the Right to Bear Arms are technologies; that these principles were developed by the philosopher John Locke (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLJRx5kx2mY); and

## WHEREAS
There are principles of Perfect Monetary Systems that can be discovered logically and created Constitutionally, that include: No Counterfeits (monetary inflation), or loss (monetary deflation), privacy, transportability, ownership and generally doing the job that data does by helping us to evaluate, economize, account and make decisions that cause an economy to emerge from the combined decisions of billions of people; That these principles were developed by the Computer Scientist Sean Worthington, (http://worthingtonwiki.com/index.php?title=Money) and

## WHEREAS
That among men there are Universally Preferable Behaviors that can be derived logically such that we should be honest with each other, not steal from another, not cause violence or harm; These principles have been outlined by the philosopher Stefan Molyneux (http://cdn.media.freedomainradio.com/feed/books/UPB/Universally_Preferable_Behaviour_UPB_by_Stefan_M
olyneux_PDF.pdf) , and

## WHEREAS
CloudCoin Consortium has conceptualized a System called RAIDA (Redundant Array of Independent
Detection Agents) that ensure that CloudCoins have only one owner, and that the owner may change within milliseconds by consent of the owner at any time and at any place or over great distances: the RAIDA Administrator has agreed to add value by creating usable detection service that allow its community to transact in CloudCoin in an enjoyable manner and to help users economize so they can live better lives. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises made by the parties to this
Agreement, the RAIDA Administrator and Sean Worthington agree as follows:

### 1. Patents & Trademarks
RAIDA Administrator may use patented authentication and RAIDA technology under the trademark
"CloudCoin" for the good of the CloudCoin community.

### 2. Tampering
The RAIDA Administrator shall not collaborate with any government, corporate, political or any other entity to compromise the privacy the software provides. Collaborating with any entity to provide backdoors, weaknesses, vulnerabilities is grounds for being ostracized from the CloudCoin Consortium and forfeiture of all payments. The RAIDA Administrator agrees to report any attempts by any entity to tamper with the RAIDA to the CloudCoin Consortium.

### 3. Availability of RAIDA Administrator
The RAIDA Administrator should be generally available and working except for vacations, holidays illnesses which should be covered by minions of the RAIDA Administrator.

### 4. Easy to manage
The RAIDA Administrator shall configure their service to maximize ease of security, provide high availability using customs and conventions and techniques that are considered best practices by the industry. The Systems and databases must facilitate change by avoiding complexity when possible and using structure that are modular and easy to reuse, maintain and change.

### 5. Marketing
The RAIDA Administrator may be asked to help, but will not be required to market CloudCoin by creating
websites based on the CloudCoin.Global website but translated into languages that make it easy, searchable and inviting to would-be CloudCoin users.

### 6. International
The official language of the CloudCoin Consortium shall be English and official business shall be conducted in English.

### 7. Communication
The RAIDA Administrator shall attend the designated news site daily (Currently www.AdminBingo.com ) and participate in social discussions on the internal social site that will improve the value of CloudCoins. The RAIDA Administrator shall attend Consortium meetings and participate in Consortium social software. The RAIDA Administrator will listen to the needs of the Consortium and make efforts to addresses these needs. avoid embarrassing errors while at the same time understanding that there is an urgent need to keep the detection service working quickly.

### 8. Collaboration
The RAIDA Administrator may coordinate and collaboration with other System Administrators, software
developers, marketing people, minions, etc. These collaborators may include people who want to donate their time or those who the RAIDA Administrator hires himself. The CloudCoin Consortium is not in any way involved with these collaborators and is not responsible for their activities or compensation (if any).

### 9. Compensation
The RAIDA Administrator shall be paid roughly 1% of all CloudCoins minted or ¤14,280,000 CloudCoins. The Developer shall be paid ¤238,027 CloudCoin each month in the first week of the month for a consecutive 60 months. The denomination of the CloudCoin is up to the Consortium but will most likely start high (250s) and end low(1s).

### 9.b. Money Block
Each of the 25 RAIDA Administrators are given a block of Serial Numbers that equal 1% of all the CloudCoins.This block is handed out over a 60 month period. This block of Serial Numbers is promised to the RAIDA Administrator so long as they meet their obligations and are in good standing.
The CloudCoin Consortium shall ensure that each RAIDA Administrator gets their block when due. When the CloudCoin doubles, so does the RAIDA Administrator block to the new networks.

### 9.C. Lost CloudCoin scavenging
Beginning five years after conception, each month the RAIDA Administrators will query for CloudCoins (on their network) that have not been authenticated in five years. The ANs for these coins will be sent to central services where they will be checked against a lost claim database. The lost claim database shall be open to inspection by RAIDA Administrators. CloudCoins that are unclaimed shall be divided amount the RAIDA administrators.

### 9.D. Penalties
Central service may choose to make echo requests against the RAIDA Administrator’s RAIDA once every
minute. For every echo request that is not returned, the RAIDA Administrator will be penalized 10 CloudCoins. The CloudCoin Consortium will employ White-Hat Hackers to probe the RAIDA Administrator’s server for vulnerabilities. Any vulnerabilities that are detected can be fined 1000 CloudCoins.

### 10. RAIDA SOFTWARE
The CloudCoin Consortium provides RAIDA Software free of charge to the RAIDA Administrator. From time to time, the RAIDA Administrator will lose data due to defects in this software. However, the RAIDA Administrator is not forced to use this software. RAIDA Administrator may make changes or completely rewrite the RAIDA software provided so long as the software complies to the API, follows the CloudCoin process and is not vulnerable to attacks. The RAIDA Administrator is free to change databases or data storage methods. The CloudCoin Consortium is not liable in any way for any loss or damage the software does. RAIDA Administrators are free to use what-ever software they like including third party software.

### 11. Independence
The Consortium does not direct the activities of the RAIDA Administrator, provide facilities or equipment to the RAIDA Administrator or manage the RAIDA Administrator’s activities and the Consortium is in no way liable for any errors that the RAIDA Administrator creates.

### 12. RAIDA Administrator's Duties
The RAIDA Administrator has a duty to meet the needs of the CloudCoin Community. The following duties are assumed:

* The RAIDA Administrator must maintain service records with central services’ Directory (IP Address,
domain name, file extensions that your RAIDA uses (such as php or aspx) so that the CloudCoin
Community can use the RAIDA Administrator’s RAIDA.

* The RAIDA Administrator must perform testing to ensure their services are working: Echo, Test, Detect, Get Ticket, Fix, Hints and services that may be added in the future.

* Testing to ensure that the RAIDA Administrator’s RAIDA can contact its trusted servers and that servers that trust it can connect to it to get fixit hints.

* Changing the RAIDAs trusted server list when one of your trusted servers is known to become
compromised.

* Fix any RAIDA vulnerabilities.

* To be a friend and fellow to CloudCoin Consortium members.

* To warn of dangers, advice on tips, share experience and promote the value of CloudCoin.

* Participate in Doubling including the cloning, recruitment, mentoring and sheparding processes.

* If terminated, hand over data in a professional manner.

* Help central services restore lost CloudCoins by running monthly queries against the AN table to find CloudCoins that have not been authenticated for years.

* Ensure minion servers are running as required (Backup, standby and secondary servers).

* Ensure your software including operating systems are licensed as needed by the rules of preferable
behavior and common respect for intellectual property.

### 12. Trusted Servers
Your RAIDA must trust other RAIDA for CloucCoins to self-repair. Other RAIDA must also trust your server. You must allow at least four other servers that trust you to connect to your server. However, at some times RAIDA may become compromised and it will be your duty to not trust any servers that are known to be compromised.

### 13. TIME ZONE
Servers must be set to UTC within 5 seconds of accuracy.
14. DOUBLING
Goal of Doubling (Which could also be quadrupling or more) is to increase the amount of CloudCoin but not change the proportion of CloudCoins that are owned by individuals. In theory, everyone’s CloudCoins double and the price will go down but the lower price will make the CloudCoins more valuable so that all CloudCoin owners actually gain value.
Doubling doubles the number of servers, number of administrators and number of networks. This spreads risk, increases bandwidth and resources and adds fault tolerance.
The Duty of the RAIDA Administrator is to clone, backup or transfer the database to the new RAIDA
Administrators designated by Sean Worthington. Sean Worthington will direct the time and destination of the transfers. The Doubling process requires the combined coordinated efforts of perhaps hundreds of people. The RAIDA Administrator may need to schedule time off from all other activities for this process. This process may take place at odd hours. The RAIDA Administrator may need to stand by for 24 hours to ensure the process goes as planned.

### 14. a. Mandatory Doubling at $2.00 value
Should the CloudCoin be valued at $2.00, the process of doubling shall take place. At $2.00 per CloudCoin a network would be worth $2.8 billion which is too much.
If the RAIDA Administrator does not double, the RAIDA Administrator may be terminated, server removed from the directory and no more payments.
RAIDA Administrator shall get to vote on doubling.
When the CloudCoin is doubled and cloned, so too is the RAIDA Administrator's money block.

### 15. Intellectual Property Rights in the Software.
The Consortium shall hold all intellectual property rights in the RAIDA including, but not limited to, copyright and trademark rights. The System Administrator agrees not to claim any such ownership in the RAIDA's intellectual property at any time prior to or after the completion and delivery of the Server to the Client. The RAIDA Administrator may develop software based on the RAIDA technology and may share it with other RAIDA Administrators but they shall not sell this to entities outside of the CloudCoin Consortium. Any software the RAIDA Administrator develops in regards to the RAIDA shall be property of the CloudCoin Consortium.

### 16. Confidentiality
The RAIDA Administrator understands that when dealing with large sums of money, there is an inherent threat as entities are highly incentivized to steal. For five years, The RAIDA Administrator shall not publish the server information, their name or location but instead use the CloudCoin Consortium. The RAIDA Administrator shall do all they can to keep from becoming a target or making a target of other people within the Consortium. This means keeping aliases, contacting others over encrypted channels, not telling the true identities of other CloudCoin entities. When needed to interface publicly, the Developer shall ask Sean Worthington (who will be in the public) or his Public Relations designee to do this job.

### 17. No Modification unless in writing.
This document can be changed by both parties agreeing but there must be an electronic paper trail to prove the changes.

### 18. Termination
In general, the RAIDA Administrator may be terminated and their Money Block transferred should they do
anything that reduces the value of CloudCoins. The RAIDA Administrator may be terminated by Sean
Worthington with advice from the CloudCoin Consortium for the first five years. After this five-year period, the RAIDA Administrator shall be granted tenor and only be fired upon the command of a majority of the other RAIDA Admins.
Any RAIDA Administrator can propose that another RAIDA Administrator be removed from the RAIDA. The
proposal shall be made by sending an email to all RAIDA Admins and scheduling a meeting of the RAIDA
Admins at least two weeks in the future from the email's delivery. After this meeting, RAIDA Admins may vote by announcing their position to all other RAIDA Admins. The voting period will last one week from the time of the meeting. The decision will be based on the majority of the votes cast. If there is a tie, the RAIDA Administrator shall stay.
When a vacancy comes open, this vacancy shall be announced to all RAIDA Administrators by the first RAIDA Admin who notices that there is a vacancy. Upon hearing of the vacancy, RAIDA Admins may propose a person who should fill this vacancy. The person who is proposed must have the technical means of a system administrator, pass a philosophical exam showing that they believe in liberty and agree to the RAIDA Constitution.
There shall be a proposal period that shall stay open until a person is proposed. Once the first person is proposed, there will be a two week waiting period in which other people can be proposed. If there is only one person who is proposed after the two week period, then that person shall become the RAIDA Administrator for life. If there are more than two candidates, the RAIDA Administrators shall vote. The election shall occur two weeks after the proposal period has ended. RAIDA Admins may vote by making their decision public. The person who receives the most votes becomes the new RAIDA Admin for life. If there is a tie vote, the first candidate to be proposed wins.
Examples of why a RAIDA Admin may be terminated:
* The RAIDA Administrators dies or becomes incapacitated.
* The RAIDA Administrator’s RAIDA is down for more than seven days in a row.
* The RAIDA Administrator’s RAIDA is constantly the slowest RAIDA taking more milliseconds to process
detection requests than other RAIDAs.
* The RAIDA Administrator’s RAIDA is confiscated or stolen.
* The RAIDA Administrator’s RAIDA’s data is destroyed, hacked or compromised.
* The RAIDA Administrator embarrasses the CloudCoin Consortium.
* The RAIDA Administrator says derogatory things about CloudCoin to the public, including specifying
defects, deficiencies or flaws. Or the RAIDA Administrator advises the public not to use CloudCoins.
* The RAIDA Administrator expresses a desire to update the values in the AN database without the
consent or knowledge of the owners of the CloudCoins affected (except for lost coins – coins that have
not been authenticated for over five years).
* The RAIDA Administrator expresses a desire to tax or aid governments in taxing CloudCoins. Note that
a tax includes any kind of so-called fees or charges or duties or taking or dues. Except for
lost-coin-recover which the RAIDA Administrators (Collectively through the CloudCoin Consortium) may
charge a recovery fee.
* The RAIDA Administrator expresses sympathy for Socialism or Communism publicly or privately to
other Consortium members.
* The RAIDA Administrator expresses sympathy for Terrorists or are followers of people who have
preached terrorism.
* The RAIDA Administrator is involved in activity considered as unpreferable behavior such as rape,
slavery, murder, theft, child abuse, suppression of natural rights or unpopular behavior such as drug
trafficking, gun running, prostitution and gambling.
* The RAIDA Administrator threatens to bring down or slow their RAIDA unless their demands are met.
* The RAIDA Administrator collaborates with entities wishing to undermine the value of CloudCoin.
* The RAIDA Administrator undermines the value of CloudCoin in a way that must be prevented in the
future to ensure CloudCoin's value.
* The RAIDA Administrator attempts to control more than two RAIDA servers.

### 19. TERMINATION AFTERMATH
Upon termination, the RAIDA Administrator may receive a final month's compensation if they export their data to central services over their data, delete all data afterwards and turn over any contact information for minions to help the continued value of CloudCoins.

### 20. SURRENDER / RETIREMENT / QUITTING
The RAIDA Administrator may surrender their RAIDA at any time by transferring their data to Central Services and deleting their Detection Service. The RAIDA Administrator shall be compensated one month’s CloudCoin for doing so in a professional manner.

### 21. CloudCoin Value
The value of CloudCoins are not guaranteed by the Consortium. It is up to all the members of the Consortium to work together to make CloudCoins valuable.

### 22. Law Suits
Users of the RAIDA will lose some money sometime due to defects in the RAIDA. The RAIDA is designed so
that defects can be repaired. RAIDA Administrators shall not make any warranties or guarantees to anyone about the availability of their service. RAIDA Administrator will advise any asking that CloudCoins are buyer-beware and neither the software developers or CloudCoin Consortium is liable in any way for any loss.

### 23. Loss of Money
To help users recover lost CloudCoins, the software shall make records of the serial numbers and month of activities so that lost money can be claimed and recovered by the user.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has executed this Constitution as of the day an year set forth
below.

//Agree upon by All RAIDA Admins. Amendments made by a general consensus.
